        <h3>PHP developer at ITCOM Krasnodar</h3>
        <p>october 2019 - october 2020</p>
        <p>I wanted to try working as a programmer fulltime within a stable team.</p>
        <p>Landed on this job as a maintainer of CRM systems and developer of new services, most of which didn't go past an MWP due to various business circumstances.</p>
        <p>I felt more resistance trying to further grow as professional - which catalysed my dismissal.</p>

        <p>11.02.2015 - 12.02.2018</p>
        <p>As communications load on facility increased overtime I started working as comms on full time.</p>
        <p>My main duties were then to maintain and expand computer, phone and security networking; maintained security appliances and surveillance; occasionally working with providers and neighbouring facilities.</p>
        <p>I decided to quit when the job staled, meaning no further expansion was to be expected. By that time I already had some success with various freelance programming jobs.</p>
