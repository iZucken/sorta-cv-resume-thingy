        <p>2017 - present</p>
        <p>
            I started out as a freelancer and still do work as one sometimes.
            Never actively sought jobs - they somehow landed on me instead.
            Jobs range from one-off scenarios to complete web projects.

        <h3>Fullstack (nominally PHP) developer at ITCOM Krasnodar</h3>
        <p>october 2019 - october 2020</p>
        <p>
            I wanted to try working as a programmer fulltime within a team.
            Landed on this job as a maintainer of CRM systems and developer of new services.
            In the process developed some prototypes and subsystems for the everchaning business needs.

        <h3>Communications Engineer</h3>
        <p>february 2015 - february 2018</p>
        <p>
            Considering company's focus on hardware (and networking), I think this is kind of relevant.
            There I had to maintain and expand digital, analog and security networking.
            Maintained security appliances and surveillance, occasionally working with service providers and neighboring facilities.
            By no stretch of the margin am I a networking guru, but the experience is nontheless valuable.

        <p>
            The project combines internal CRMs and crypto apis into a pcks issuing business process.
            Also had to implement a somewhat complicated frontend with interop layers using vanilla js and a bunch of third party providers.

        </p>
        <p>
            Due to a recent COVID lockdown, a service had to be implemented that would enable remote verification.
            My job was to setup the php interop backend layer for the CRM and video calls, as well as develop a specific video processing features.
            Execution required delving into a few of streaming and video processing specifics.
            Primary streaming concerns were handled by a Janus webrtc server.

        </p>
        <p>
            I had to create a scalable, generic solution to support parsing multiple types of resources into multiple types of datums, to be later enriched with modules to support more types.
            Basically a bunch of workers and a task manager with a generic contract for additional modules.
            Crud and export functionality based on easyadmin for business access.

            I would like to just denote the overall experience with multiple CRM systems and integrations between them and third party systems and software.
            In due process a lot of work was put into refactoring legacy systems to support new requirements.
            For the purposes of integrations some new concepts were introduced into organisation's development practices, e.g. messaging...

            One of my oldest projects, its development started with "techniques" straight from 2000 by another contractor.
            During continuous improvement it migrated to a more modern standards.
            Backend features multiple integrations with image processing related services.
            For admin purposes a few specialised UI's and workflows were implemented.

            This is a special category of quite commonly occuring one-off jobs.
            In the context I usually have to analyse the data structure in the source (unsupportable legacy system) with little to no info available, develop an export scenario or a process, and then map that as accurately as possible to a target system, considering the differences.

            I had an opportunity to implement fixes and features for the legacy Vue/Laravel project made initially by another contractor.
            Due to some an array of circumstances the owner decided to create a new separate frontend layer for it.
            Now it is an in-development next.js project I seldom audit... I am also providing assistance in filtering of contractors.
            To migrate initial hybrid php/js structure to SPA a developed a <a href="https://api.aviaks.com/api/public/docs">rest api</a> for it (public while in dev.).

        <p>
            Inherited the project from a contractor gone missing.
            This had put my debugging and uncrangling skills to the test.
            I had to fix issues preventing this project from providing at least a bare minimum of supposed functionality.
            Currently I develop a new backend and a next.js frontend with specialised UI as a replacement, current implementation will go down.
