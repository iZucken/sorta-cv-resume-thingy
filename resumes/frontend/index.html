<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
    <li>~3 years of experience with frontend related technologies.</li>
    <li>Using best practices and always on the look for the better ones.</li>
    <li>Actually have more experience with backend technologies.</li>
    <li>Primary catalyst for my professional development is somewhat of a dream of acquiring a meaningful job.</li>
</ul>
<h2>More on relevant skills</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Know vanilla js pretty well within the sandbox.</li>
    <li>Picked up typescript, now got a paranoia of @types/* declarations mismatch...</li>
    <li>Create components and spa with Vue 2.</li>
    <li>Having quite an easy time with React and mobx.</li>
    <li>For ssr/hybrid frontend found Next.js to be pretty easy and overall quite good.</li>
    <li>Had no problems utilising webpack... Never really had a need for other build tools like gulp/grunt.</li>
    <li>Didn't have an opportunity to fully utilise jest commercially yet, have a backend testing experience.</li>
    <li>Have used bootstrap 3+, tbh I don't like it. Prefer sass and css modules.</li>
    <li>Pure HTML/CSS markup speed is not my strongest point.</li>
    <li>To return await Promise or not to return await Promise?</li>
    <li>Shell, git, little bit of gitlab ci, docker, eslint, etc.</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Freelancing</h3>
        <p>2017 - present</p>
        <p>
            I started out as a freelancer and still do work as one sometimes.
            I never actively sought jobs, instead they landed on me.
            Jobs range from one-off scenarios to complete web projects.
            Planning to quit after finishing my current project, it is overall just not enjoyable.

        <h3>Fullstack developer at ITCOM Krasnodar</h3>
        <p>22.10.2019 - 31.12.2019</p>
        <p>
            I wanted to try working as a programmer fulltime within a stable team.
            Landed on this job as a maintainer of CRM systems and developer of new services.
            Most of them didn't go past an MWP due to various business circumstances.
            Decided to quit after there was no more room left to grow professionally.

            One of my oldest projects, it was initially developed using techniques straight from 2000.
            During continuous improvement it acquired specialised UI elements made with Vue and a modern build process.
            This showcases my personal development a little bit and a gradual project modernisation abilities.

            In the context of this project I had to create an interop layer based on promises for different types of cryptographic apis,
            supporting different extensions for different browsers.
            All vanilla, compiled with babel due to peculiarities of the backend and initial stages of development.
            This showcases my ability to work with complicated frontend apis in restricting conditions.

            I had an opportunity to implement some fixes and features for the legacy Vue / Laravel project made initially by another contractor.
            Due to some an array of circumstances the owner decided to create a new separate frontend layer for it.
            Now it is a next.js project I partially curate and audit... I am also providing assistance in filtering of contractors.
            This showcases my ability to both support and improve a foreign code base.

            Application was intended as a UI for a cloud cash register backend system made in compliance with new russian tax and cash registry laws.
            Developed was based on a swagger schema and a mock server.
            Unfortunately, functional backend was never released and the project got frozen.
            This could be a good showcase of my vue spa skills...

            This has put my debugging and uncrangling skills to the test.
            I had to fix several issues preventing this project from providing at least a bare minimum of functionality
            using only the uglified build files,
            because previous contractor disappeared without leaving the source code behind.
            Currently I develop a new backend and a next.js frontend with specialised editing ui for it.
            This will greatly showcase my modern frontend development capabilities upon completion.
